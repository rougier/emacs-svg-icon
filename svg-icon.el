;;; Commentary:

;; This library allows to create svg icons by parsing remote collections
;; whose license are compatibles with GNU Emacs:
;;
;; - Boxicons (https://github.com/atisawd/boxicons), available under a
;;   Creative Commons 4.0 license.  As of version 2.07 (December 2020),
;;   this collection offers 1500 icons in two styles (regular & solid).
;;   Gallery is available at https://boxicons.com/
;;
;; - Octicons (https://github.com/primer/octicons), available under a
;;   MIT License with some usage restriction for the GitHub logo.  As of
;;   version 11.2.0 (December 2020), this collection offers 201 icons.
;;   Gallery available at https://primer.style/octicons/
;;
;; - Material (https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign),
;;   available under an Apache 2.0 license.  As of version 5.8.55
;;   (December 2020), this collection offers 5000+ icons in 4 styles
;;   (filled, outlined, rounded, sharp).  Gallery available at
;;   https://materialdesignicons.com/
;;
;; - Bootstrap (https://github.com/twbs/icons), available under an MIT
;;   license.  As of version 1.2.1 (December 2020), this collection
;;   offers 1200+ icons in 2 styles (regular & filled).  Gallery
;;   available at https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
;;
;; The default size of an icon is exactly 2x1 characters such that it
;; can be inserted inside a text without disturbing alignment.
;;
;; Note: Each icon is cached locally to speed-up loading the next time
;;       you use it.  If for some reason the cache is corrupted you can
;;       force reload using the svg-icon-get-data function.
;;
;; If you want to add new collections (i.e. URL), make sure the icons
;; are monochrome, their size is consistent.

Icon is drawn using FG-COLOR (default is `default' face's foreground)

level control the size of the icon. Default size is 2x1 characters.
FG-COLOR or BG-COLOR also could be a face.  In this case colors
specified in `:foreground' or `:background' attribute is used.

MARGIN-DIVIDER is used to calculate overall margin size for resulting
svg icon in case its size is larger then original svg image.  Overall
margin will equal to svg icon height divided by MARGIN-DIVIDER,
meaning the larger MARGIN-DIVIDER you specify the smaller margins you
get.  By default MARGIN-DIVIDER is equal to 2, i.e. half of the image
is for the margins. MARGIN-DIVIDER can't be 0 for the obvious reasons.
If resulting svg icon is smaller then original svg image, then
resulting image will have no margins, and MARGIN-DIVIDER is ignored."
